# How to play

# Basic how to play (not extensive): 

You are creating a potion to give yourself superpowers but you have to guess which potion combo is correct. There are 7 different potions that give different powers. You have 6 times to get it correct, if you get all 6 wrong, the lab will blow!

On the right side, there are 4 indicators to let you know if your combination is correct, incorrect or misplaced. 

if your combination has a misplaced position, the indicator will light yellow for the specific position. This means the potion color is correct, but not in the correct spot.

If your combination has one potion color in the correct space, the indicator will light green for the specific condition.

If your combination has one or more potion color that is not used by the computer, the indicator will light grey.

## Win/Lose Condition
If the user guesses within the 6 tries, they get to keep the potions and the mad scientist is angrier! But, if the user runs out of guesses, then they don't get to keep the potions and the mad scientist is happy!

p.s. this game is similar to wordle, you are trying to guess what code combination the computer has in their mind, but it will help you along the way!

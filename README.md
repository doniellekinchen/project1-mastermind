Power, Potions & Destruction â€” oh my! (Mastermind)

Creating the perfect potion to give yourself the ultimate superpowers, but only at the recommendation of the mad scientist! Guess what the mad scientist recommendation is and you get to keep the potion!

# How to play

## Basic how to play (not extensive): 

You are creating a potion to give yourself superpowers but you have to guess which potion combo is correct. There are 7 different potions that give different powers. You have 6 times to get it correct.

If you get the combination correct within the 6 tries, you get to keep the potion, but the mad scientist is NOT happy!

If you get all 6 wrong, then it's game over, and the mad scientist gets to keep your potion secrets! 
Keep in mind, the mad scientist will not use the same color twice!

On the right side (col 5), each box for each row will show red if it's incorrect, or green if it's correct! 

p.s. This game is similar to wordle, you are trying to guess what code combination the computer has in their mind, but it will kind of help you along the way! Good luck and have fun!!

# Future Features

I hope to add the following features to my game:
- add a function to tell the user if he has the right choice but in the wrong box
- when the potion button is pressed, instead of a color block that fills the main table, an actual image of the potion will appear.
